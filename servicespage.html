          bypass technique. Manipulation only requires fingers, eyes, and proper technique, though it is a skill that
          takes years to develop. While manipulation of combination locks is usually performed on Group 2 locks, many
          Group 1 locks are susceptible to manipulation. It involves the manipulation of the lock in order to obtain the
          combination one number at a time.Manipulation procedures can vary, but they all rely on exploiting the
          presence of mechanical imperfections in the lock, unlocking the safe and recovering its combination, which can
          then be reused to open the safe lock.</p>
        <p class="content">Mechanical safe locks are manipulated primarily by feel and vision, with sound helping the
          process occasionally. To find the combination the operator uses the lock against itself by measuring internal
          movements with the dial numbers. More sophisticated locks use advanced mechanics to reduce any feedback a
          technician could use to identify a combination. These group 1 locks were developed in response to group 2 lock
          manipulation. Wheels made from lightweight materials will reduce valuable sensory feedback, but are mainly
          used for improved resistance against radiographic attacks. Manipulation is often the preferred choice in
          lost-combination lockouts, since it requires no repairs or damage, but can be time consuming for an operator,
          the specific difficulty depends on the unique wheel shapes and where the gates rest in relation to them. A
          novice's opening time will be governed by these random inconsistencies, while some leading champions of this
          art show consistency. There are also a number of tools on the market to assist safe engineers in manipulating
          a combination lock open in the field.</p>
        <p class="content">Nearly all combination locks allow some "slop" while entering a combination on the dial. On
          average 1% radial rotation in either direction from the center of the true combination number to allow the
          fence to fall despite slight deviation, so that for a given safe it may be necessary only to try a subset of
          the combinations. Such "slops" may allow for a margin of error of plus or minus two digits, which means that
          trying multiples of five would be sufficient in this case. This drastically reduces the time required to
          exhaust the number of meaningful combinations. A further reduction in solving time is obtained by trying all
          possible settings for the last wheel for a given setting of the first wheels before nudging the next-to-last
          wheel to its next meaningful setting, instead of zeroing the lock each time with a number of turns in one
          direction.</p>
